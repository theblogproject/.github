<h3 align="center">Providing new possibilities for writers and authors.</h3>

<h2>What is TheBlog?</h2>
<p>The blog is a new social network that wants to connect authors of articles, books or other literature with readers. Therefore the authors should have the possibility to be seen upon the great amount of literature today, but also to attract their group of readers and win new readers. In addition the authors can manage the payment by themselves. They can decide between an abo, one time payment or other payment options.</p>
<p>Additionally this is also a great tool for readers. They can provide their interests, and get rewarded with the matching literature they want to read, which saves time for the readers for reading. Besides, the reader don't need to order a book, because they can easily read the digital form at TheBlog.</p>
